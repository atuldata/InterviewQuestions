#Phone Screen
My phone screens usually only last 15-20 minutes. I look for a few simple things:
Can this person communicate such that I can understand them? 
Are they able to get to the point quickly and be clear with their explanations?
Can this person answer simple programming language questions?
How about simple linux commands?
Do they know the basic data structures? How about big O notation?
#Here are some sample questions to pick from.
#Sample Programming Language Questions (Java, since that is mostly what the data team uses)
There are modifiers you can add to class variables in Java: public, private, protected, and default. What is the difference between all these? Most people get all but default correct.
What are generics and why are they useful?
What is the difference between static and non-static variables?
What does it mean when you mark a variable as transient? volatile?
When would you use a linked list vs a vector? How about a primitive array (i.e. not ArrayList)?
#Sample Linux Questions

Let's say your linux box seems really busy and you want to find out what is going on. How?
You have a process that isn't responding and you want to see what it is doing, how?
#Sample Algorithm Questions
